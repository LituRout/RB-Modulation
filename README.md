# RB-Modulation: Training-Free Personalization of Diffusion Models using Stochastic Optimal Control
## ðŸ”¥ Code release: Official implementation has been released in https://github.com/google/RB-Modulation

Official PyTorch implementation of [**RB-Modulation: Training-Free Personalization of Diffusion Models using Stochastic Optimal Control**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17401).

Given reference images of preferred style or content, our method, **RB-Modulation**, offers a plug-and-play solution for (a) stylization with various prompts, and (b)
composition with reference content images while maintaining sample diversity and prompt alignment.
